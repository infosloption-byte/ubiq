## Phase A — Database Migrations

- [x] A1 — Core plan tables: `plans`, `plan_features`
- [x] A2 — User/plan linkage: `users.plan_id` FK + `user_plan_overrides` table
- [x] A3 — Usage counters: `usage_counters` table (fast increment/check path)
- [x] A4 — Audit log: `plan_action_logs` table
- [x] A5 — Seeders: seed 4 plans (free/starter/creator/pro) + their features, re-runnable upsert

## Phase B — Backend

- [x] B1 — `PlanService`: load + cache plan limits, resolve overrides
- [x] B2 — `PlanGuard`: central check/authorize chokepoint, fail-closed, writes to `plan_action_logs`
- [x] B3a — Wire `PlanGuard` into `ai.request` (CompletionController/AiController) — first action, lowest risk
- [x] B3b — Wire `PlanGuard` into `sandbox.start` (ProjectController::runProject) + release on stop/cleanup
- [x] B3c — Wire `PlanGuard` into `project.create`
- [ ] B3d — Wire `PlanGuard` into `sharing.enabled` / model tier access
- [x] B3e — Global concurrency ceiling check (total active sandboxes vs. box capacity)
- [ ] B4 — Retire old scattered logic: `CompletionController::$rateLimits` array, `available_models.tier_required` direct checks, `subscription_tier` column
- [ ] B5 — Admin CRUD endpoints: `GET/POST/PUT /admin/plans`, `/admin/plans/{id}/features`
- [ ] B6 — Reporting helpers against `plan_action_logs` (denial rate by tier/action, usage percentiles)

## Phase C — Frontend

- [ ] C1 — Usage widget: `GET /me/usage`, live counts vs. limits in admin/user dashboard
- [ ] C2 — Structured limit-hit handling: denial payload → friendly upgrade prompt (not generic 429 toast)
- [ ] C3 — Public pricing page sourced live from `GET /plans`
- [ ] C4 — Upgrade/downgrade flow via PayPal, webhook updates `users.plan_id`, downgrade-over-limit policy (grandfather existing, block new)
- [ ] C5 — Internal admin UI to edit `plan_features` values directly

## Notes / decisions log

(Add dated entries here when a design decision changes mid-build — e.g. a
feature_key gets renamed, a limit default changes, a phase gets reordered.)

- 2026-07-28 — Phase A complete. Sentinel convention: `-1` means "unlimited"
  for numeric `plan_features` values (used by `projects.max_count` on Pro).
  `users.subscription_tier` kept (deprecated, not dropped) until B4 — every
  controller still reads it until PlanGuard replaces those checks action by
  action.

- 2026-07-28 — B1/B2 complete. Found `.env.example` sets `CACHE_STORE=database`
  but no `cache`/`cache_locks` tables have ever existed in this project —
  added migration `2026_07_28_000005_create_cache_tables.php` as a
  prerequisite fix, since `PlanService` needed a working cache and this
  would otherwise have surfaced as a silent production outage.
  `PlanGuard::check()` is read-only and does NOT write to `plan_action_logs`
  (used for UI pre-flight checks); only `authorize()` is audited — this
  narrows the original architecture note slightly to avoid flooding the log
  with polling reads. `evaluateRate()`'s check-then-increment is not
  transaction-locked (minor race window under burst traffic) — noted as an
  acceptable v1 tradeoff, upgrade to `lockForUpdate()` if it becomes a real
  issue. `project.create` counts live `projects` rows rather than an
  incrementing counter, so it self-corrects on deletion.

- 2026-07-28 — B3a complete. `CompletionController`'s old `$rateLimits`
  array + `checkRateLimit()` (the method that already caused the
  Paddle→PayPal 'premium'/'pro' key-mismatch bug) is now fully replaced by
  `PlanGuard::authorize($user, 'ai.request')` across all 5 AI-calling
  endpoints (`generate`, `complete`, `review`, `debug`, `explain`).
  `chat()` had NO rate limiting at all before this — added the guard there
  too, closing a real gap rather than just migrating existing behavior.
  `checkRateLimit()` left in place as a throwing stub (not deleted) so any
  external caller surfaces loudly instead of silently no-op'ing; confirmed
  no other file calls it. Added `PlanGuard::remaining()` as a small reusable
  addition — used here for the `remaining_requests` response field, and
  will be reused by Phase C1's `GET /me/usage` endpoint. The old
  `rate_limits` DB table/model is now unused but not dropped yet — safe to
  drop once B4 does the full old-logic retirement pass.

- 2026-07-28 — B3b complete. `ProjectController::runProject` now checks
  `PlanGuard::authorize($user, 'sandbox.start')` before any file writes or
  docker calls; released on both docker-run failure paths (no free ports,
  docker start failure), on explicit `stopProject()`, and on
  `CleanupSandboxes` auto-stop. Also closed a gap while here: `sandbox.cpu`
  and `sandbox.memory_mb` were seeded per-tier in Phase A but never actually
  read anywhere — `docker run` was hardcoded to `--cpus=0.75` and
  runtime-based memory regardless of plan. Now reads tier values from
  `PlanService`; memory uses `max(tier_value, runtime_minimum)` rather than
  a hard cap, since a Node/Angular build genuinely needs ~700-900MB to not
  OOM and silently failing free-tier builds wasn't a deliberate call — swap
  to `min()` if a hard tier ceiling is wanted instead. Similarly,
  `sandbox.idle_timeout_minutes` was seeded but unused — `CleanupSandboxes`
  used one flat `--hours=2` for everyone; now checks each open sandbox
  against its owner's plan-specific timeout (kept `--hours` as an explicit
  manual override for emergency sweeps, removed it from the hourly
  schedule in `routes/console.php`). Known limitation: cleanup still runs
  hourly, so a Free-tier sandbox nominally capped at 20min idle can
  actually hold resources up to ~80min worst-case before the cron catches
  it — tighten the schedule frequency if that gap matters in practice.
  Also noted: the frontend's own idle-warning threshold (ProjectRunner) is
  a separate hardcoded 2h value, now out of sync with the per-tier backend
  timeout — flagged for Phase C, not fixed here (backend-only phase).

- 2026-07-29 — B3c complete. Wired `PlanGuard::authorize('project.create')`
  into `ProjectController::store()` and `import()` — the latter had NO
  project-count check before at all (only a storage check), a real gap
  closed here, same pattern as `chat()` in B3a. While in this file, found
  the exact same hardcoded-constant drift bug a third time: `STORAGE_LIMIT_
  FREE`/`STORAGE_LIMIT_PRO` were duplicated verbatim in both `User.php` and
  `ProjectController.php` with a comment literally saying "must stay in
  sync" — plus a third consumer in `FileController::upload()` via
  `User::isOverStorageLimit()`. Added a new `storage.check` PlanGuard
  action (type='bytes') backed by a new `storage.max_mb` plan_features key
  (seeded: free=512, starter=1024, creator=5120, pro=10240 — same
  "-1 = unlimited" sentinel convention). All three call sites now route
  through PlanGuard, giving storage limit checks an audit trail for the
  first time. `getStorageLimitBytes()` in ProjectController is now a
  throwing stub (confirmed zero remaining callers); `User::
  getTotalStorageLimitInBytes()`/`isOverStorageLimit()` were left as
  functional delegating wrappers instead of stubs, since they're public
  model methods a private controller method isn't — safer to keep them
  correct than to risk an unseen caller. `getUserUsedBytes()` in
  ProjectController now delegates to `User::getUsedStorageBytes()` instead
  of duplicating the same DB query verbatim (found as a second copy of the
  identical query). `storageStats()` (the read-only usage endpoint) now
  returns `unlimited: true` with null limit fields for Pro — frontend
  isn't updated yet to handle that shape (Phase C).

- 2026-07-30 — B3e complete, done ahead of B3d (reordered per the cost
  report's finding that capacity, not model-tier policy, was the live risk).
  Added a box-wide ceiling to `sandbox.start` via a new `SANDBOX_GLOBAL_
  CONCURRENT_LIMIT` env var (default 3), checked in `PlanGuard::
  evaluateConcurrent()` after the per-user check so per-user denials still
  report the more specific reason (`concurrent_limit_exceeded` vs the
  fallback `global_capacity_reached`). IMPORTANT BUG CAUGHT BEFORE SHIP:
  `ACTIONS` was a `private const` array — PHP does not allow function calls
  (`env()`) inside const expressions, which would have been a fatal error
  the moment this class loaded. Converted `ACTIONS` to a `private function
  actions(): array` method instead (rebuilt per call — cheap, and
  `PlanService`'s caching is what matters for perf, not this). Also
  tightened `CleanupSandboxes`'s schedule from `->hourly()` to
  `->everyFifteenMinutes()`, closing the B3b-flagged gap where Free tier's
  nominal 20min idle timeout could actually hold resources up to ~80min
  worst-case. B3d (model tier gating) remains open pending a policy
  decision: should `ai.max_model_tier` restrict BYO-key models like Gemini
  (which cost nothing to serve) the same way it restricts self-hosted
  Ollama models, or only the latter?
